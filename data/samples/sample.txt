# RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique used in natural language processing that combines retrieval-based and generation-based approaches to produce more accurate and informative responses.

## How RAG Works

1. **Retrieval**: When a query is received, the system searches through a knowledge base to find relevant documents or passages.
2. **Augmentation**: The retrieved information is used to augment or provide context for the generation step.
3. **Generation**: A language model generates a response based on both the user query and the retrieved information.

## Benefits of RAG

- **Improved Accuracy**: By grounding responses in retrieved information, RAG reduces hallucinations and factual errors.
- **Up-to-date Information**: The knowledge base can be updated independently of the language model.
- **Transparency**: Sources can be cited to show where information came from.
- **Efficiency**: No need to retrain the entire language model to update knowledge.

## Applications

RAG is commonly used in:
- Question answering systems
- Chatbots
- Customer support
- Research assistance
- Content generation with factual backing

## Implementation Components

A typical RAG system consists of:
1. A document store or vector database
2. An embedding model for semantic search
3. A retriever component
4. A language model for generation
5. A prompt engineering strategy
