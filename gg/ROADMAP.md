# RecallAI Implementation Roadmap

This document outlines the planned features and enhancements for the RecallAI project.

## Current Status
- ✅ Basic Flask application structure is in place
- ✅ API endpoints defined for home, load, and chat
- ✅ Environment variable management with python-dotenv
- ✅ Placeholder responses for API endpoints

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Document Processing
- [ ] Fix dependency issues in `requirements.txt`
- [ ] Implement PDF document loading with `pdfplumber`
- [ ] Implement text file loading
- [ ] Implement Wikipedia article loading
- [ ] Add proper text chunking with `langchain-text-splitters`

### Phase 2: Vector Database Setup
- [ ] Set up FAISS vector database
- [ ] Implement document embedding with `sentence-transformers`
- [ ] Enable storing and loading vector indices
- [ ] Implement similarity search for document retrieval

### Phase 3: LLM Integration
- [ ] Set up Google's Gemini API integration
- [ ] Create context-aware prompts for the LLM
- [ ] Format responses with source citations
- [ ] Add fallback to local models option

### Phase 4: API Refinements
- [ ] Add authentication to API endpoints
- [ ] Implement conversation history
- [ ] Add more detailed error handling
- [ ] Improve API response formatting

### Phase 5: Frontend and Deployment
- [ ] Create a simple web interface
- [ ] Package application for deployment
- [ ] Add documentation
- [ ] Performance optimizations

## Known Issues
- Dependencies are conflicting, particularly with LangChain packages
- The Flask application has trouble running in the background in the current environment
- Need to install each dependency group separately to resolve conflicts

## Solutions
- Use more specific version requirements in `requirements.txt`
- Consider using Docker for deployment to isolate the environment
- Implement the components incrementally, starting with the document loading
